# PodPackageManager
Often, for troubleshooting or other purposes, you need to download and install a package inside a POD. If you're familiar with DNS Name Resolution in Kubernetes, you know that the DNS traffic for a POD goes through a process related to Kubernetes' CoreDNS. After a copy of the /etc/resolv.conf file from the Kubernetes node is provided to the POD, the Name Resolution process, if CoreDNS doesn't have the authority for the required record, has to forward the request to another DNS server to get the desired address. However, my focus isn't on DNS but on creating a centralized solution for setting up a central Package Manager for the PODs inside Kubernetes.

That's why I created a docker-compose file consisting of a Nexus Repository and an Nginx Reverse Proxy. This setup routes the traffic for any package, depending on your needs (like Python, .NET, or anything else), based on the path, and proxies it to the Nexus repository. The package is then downloaded by Nexus and made available to the POD. I also configured package management in Nginx, which you can customize according to your needs. I'll discuss the docker-compose and Nginx configuration here.
